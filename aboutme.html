                <h2>A little about me</h2>
                <p>
                    Ok, some words about me. My name is Theodoros or Thodoris. It is a Greek name and means "gift by god". But what I really prefer to be calld is Kouleris which is my last name. Anyway, even if I grew up in a Greek Orthodox family I am an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism">atheist</a>. My native language is Greek but I can speak English very well too. I learned English when I was a kid by watching a lot of cartoons on the T.V..
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was born in 1982 on September 22nd and astrologists say that my sign is  virgo. I really have the most of the characteristics of a virgo but what I really am is an <a href="http://www.personalitypage.com/INTJ.html">INTJ</a>. I was always a geek. I was passing my time by watching cartoons, reading comic books and playing video games. You might say that those things are something that every child does. Indeed, but when you become an adult and you still do the same things is not normal. Anyway, I had my first video game console when I was 7 years old. It was an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600">Atari 2600</a>. After that I bought some more video game consoles like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy">Game Boy</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System">Famicom knock-off</a>(very popular in Greece) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Mega_Drive">Sega Mega Drive</a>(Sega Genesis for the US people). Sadly I don't have any of those now. In the year 2010 I bought a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable">Sony PSP</a> and an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox360">Xbox360</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had my first computer in 1997 and my life change dramaticaly since then. That year I decided that I want to go to a University that I can learn more about computers. And I did it. In 2000 I went to Technological Education Institute of Lamia where I learned various things not only by the lessons that I attended but also by the people that I met there. I worked as an administrator of the computer lab in the Nurse school and after that I worked for 6 months as a Network technical support staff in <a href="http://www.compuservice.gr/">Compuforce ltd</a>.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next important stop of my life was when I went for my military training. Those may were hard times because of the small amount of sleep that we were getting but great times because all the fun I had with the other soldiers. After my military training I started working again in Compuforce ltd until the end of July 2007 when I resigned. For a short period of time I teached networks, data bases, microprocessors and linux at <a href="http://www.delta-iek.gr">Delta Vocational Training Institute</a>. Since 2009 I worked as a web developer and IT at <a href="http://www.cocoon.gr">Cocoon Ecoclima</a> until 2016 when I resigned.

                <h2>My free time</h2>
                <p>
                    When I have free time I like to program, watch movies, listen to music, read books and comics or play video games. My favorite kind of music is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music">metal</a>. My favorite bands are Blind Guardian, Rhapsody, Black Sabbath, Dream Evil, Nightwish, Manowar and Cradle of filth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2013 I started a small youtube show, reviewing old video games. The name of the show is Greek Gamer and you can find a list of the videos <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/darkheart220982">here</a>. Unfortunately the show is in Greek language so only people who can understand Greek can view it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also like programming. I usually write in C/C++ but I want to learn programming in Java too. After a lot of experimentation I decided that my favorite filed of programming is web developing. I have three computers that I use everyday.
                </p>
                <h2>The Computers</h2>
