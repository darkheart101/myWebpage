			<p>This section is about short poems that i write from time to time.</p>
			<h2>Escape from this chamber</h2>
			<p>
				Trapped in a wet filthy chamber<br/>
				Not alone but with my anger<br/>
				Having only a twisted mind<br/>
				To avoid my sameless cry<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				Walls made of human flesh<br/>
				Covered the box of emptyness<br/>
				The chamber wanted to take my mind<br/>
				But giving it up was a crime<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				Escape from this chamber a voice said to me<br/>
				Escape from this chamber and listen to me<br/>
				The chamber has the mind<br/>
				The chamber has the soul<br/>
				From people like you who are bind in this hole<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				I searched the bottom i searched the side<br/>
				But there was no way to find a light<br/>
				I saw a knife which pointing at me<br/>
				I found the escape<br/>
				Just killing me<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				The chamber shout don't do that to me<br/>
				Killing yourself is like killing me<br/>
				I rised the knife<br/>
				I put it in me<br/>
				I killed the chamber<br/>
				by killing me<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				Escape from this chamber a voice said to me<br/>
				Escape from this chamber and listen to me<br/>
				The chamber has the mind<br/>
				The chamber has the soul<br/>
				From people like you who are bind in this hole<br/>
			</p>
			<h2>Salvation</h2>
			<p>
				Every morning the same sun<br/>
				Dark,vicious i'll be damn<br/>
				Every people see him bright<br/>
				But my eyes don't see light<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				Every man in this world<br/>
				Wants the sun to live more<br/>
				To live in lies and deception<br/>
				Everyone has affection<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				But me the child of a non existing god<br/>
				Sees this deception, knows this affection<br/>
				And what he wants...<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				SALVATION<br/>
				SALVATION<br/>
				I want salvation<br/>
				I want salvation<br/>
				I don't want this deception<br/>
				I don't want this affection<br/>
				I just want salvation<br/>
				I want salvation<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				...and when this false sun goes away<br/>
				Is when no one wants to be awake<br/>
				They are afraid the truth, they are afraid the night<br/>
				They don't have the need for salvation<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				but me<br/>
				The child of a non existing god<br/>
				Does not afraid the truth, does not afraid the night<br/>
				And what he wants...<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				SALVATION<br/>
				SALVATION<br/>
				I want salvation<br/>
				I want salvation<br/>
				I don't want this deception<br/>
				I don't want this affection<br/>
				I just want salvation<br/>
				I want salvation<br/>
			</p>
			<h2>Patience my friend</h2>
			<p>
				They threw me in a green grave<br/>
				They grabed me with brown chains<br/>
				The first thing they said:<br/>
				"Obey to your master obey to me<br/>
				Do as i say and never feel free"<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				They order me to sleep<br/>
				They order me to eat<br/>
				They suck my life my brain my dreams<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				Patience, patience, patience my friend<br/>
				Stand in your feet and you'll win at the end<br/>
				Patience, patience, patience my friend<br/>
				You are the one who fucks at the end<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				Go to eat i order you go to sleep i say<br/>
				I am your master and DO as i say<br/>
				I have the power to break this chains<br/>
				I have the power to destroy this grave<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				And my only weapon...<br/>
				Patience, patience,patience my friend<br/>
			</p>
			<h2>That Licker</h2>
			<p>
				I was born without heart<br/>
				in the sign of love<br/>
				i fought against the sign<br/>
				but nothing was fine<br/>
				i fought and i fought<br/>
				untill my strength fall out<br/>
				i touched the star<br/>
				and the star sailed away<br/>
				Oh! I hate this pain<br/>
				i was lost in a desert of people<br/>
				the last thing i remember...<br/>
				me drinking a licker<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				drinking that licker<br/>
				made my pain sweeter<br/>
				drinking that licker<br/>
				cleaned all my bitter<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				i climbed on the heightest mountain<br/>
				but god pushed me while i was drinking from the fountain<br/>
				i was falling forever...untill i discovered that licker<br/>
				a small sip and i had wings,<br/>
				an other sip and i ruled the world<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				drinking that licker<br/>
				made my pain sweeter<br/>
				drinking that licker<br/>
				cleaned all my bitter<br/>
			</p>
			<h2>My love killed me</h2>
			<p>
				Our love was dark but we had light<br/>
				we could walk side by side<br/>
				drinking love all the time.<br/>
				</p>
				<p>
				The earth stood still<br/>
				when i read the novel of my nightmare<br/>
				devils made my already broken heart to bleed<br/>
				hitting with their deadly swords<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				blood was there but i was not dead<br/>
				the scythe of destiny ripped my hurt<br/>
				and gave it to her while<br/>
				she was turning the lights off<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				now the dark love<br/>
				became melancholy and hope<br/>
				was just a word with no meaning<br/>
				I died today<br/>
				my ghost will hunt my dreams<br/>
				i died today<br/>
				the black night of the future saw me<br/>
				my queen...<br/>
				riding a white horse<br/>
				and i was dead admiring her<br/>
				through my grave<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				i died today and there is no resurrection for me<br/>
				she threw on me 5 roses and a daisy<br/>
				but when they came to me<br/>
				there were tails from a whip<br/>
				i died today and there is no resurrection for me<br/>
