			<h2>A little about me</h2>
			<p>
				Ok, some words about me. My name in this world is Theodoros. It is a Greek name and means "gift by god". Anyway I dont like people to call me Theodoros or even Thodoris which is the shorter version of my name because i am an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism">atheist</a> and i have nothing to do with something that - in my opinion - does not exist. I prefer to be called Kouleris (my last name) or even better darkheart (with a lowercase d) which is my nickname. The nickname darkheart came by my pesimist way of thinking. My native language is Greek but I can speak English very well too. I learned English when I was a kid by watching a lot of cartoons on the T.V..

				I was born in 1982 on 22nd of September and astrologists say that my sign is  virgo. I really have the most of the characteristics of a virgo but what i really am is an <a href="http://www.personalitypage.com/INTJ.html">INTJ</a>. I was never a normal kid. I was a geek from the fist time I was born. I was passing my time by watching cartoons, reading comic books and playing video games.You might say that those things are something that every child. Indeed, but when you become an adult and you still do the same things is not ordinary. Anyway, I had my first video game console when i was 7 years old. It was an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600">Atari 2600</a>. After that i bought some more video game consoles like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy">Game Boy</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System">Famicom</a>(the japanese version of NES) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Mega_Drive">Sega Mega Drive</a>(Sega Genesis for the US people). Sadly i don't have any of those now. In the year 2010 i managed to buy a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable">Sony PSP</a> and an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox360">Xbox360</a>.

				My first computer was bought in 1997 and my life change dramaticaly since then. That year I decided that I want to go to a University that I can learn more about computers. And I did it. In 2000 i went to Technological Education Institute of Lamia where I learned various things not only by the lessons that i attended but also by the people that I met there. I worked as an administrator of the computer lab in the Nurse school and after that I worked for 6 months as a Network technical support staff in <a href="http://www.compuservice.gr/">Compuforce ltd</a>.  
			</p>
			<p>
				The next important stop of my life was when I went for military training. Those may were hard times because of the small amount of sleep that we were getting but great times because all the fun i had with the other soldiers. After my military training i started working again in Compuforce ltd until the end of July 2007 when i resigned. For a short period of time i teached networks, data bases, microprocessors and linux at <a href="http://www.delta-iek.gr">Delta Vocational Training Institute</a>. Now I work at <a href="http://www.cocoon.gr">Cocoon Kanellopoulos</a>.

			<h2>My free time</h2>
			<p>
				When i have free time I like to program, watch movies, listen to music , reading books and comics or play video games. I drink alcohol and smoke cigars, cigaretts or pipe. I like the kind of music that people call <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music">metal</a>. My favorite bands are Blind Guardian, Rhapsody, Black Sabbath, Dream Evil, Nightwish, Manowar and Cradle of filth. Sporadically I write <a href="./lyrics.html">short poems</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lately I started a small youtube show, reviewing old video games. The name of the show is Greek Gamer and you can find a list of the videos <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/darkheart220982">here</a>. Unfortunately the show is in Greek language so only people who can understand Greek can view it.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also like programming. I usually write in C/C++ but I want to learn programming in Java too. I have three computers that i use everyday.
			</p>
			<h2>The Computers</h2>
			<p>
				<b>Athena:</b> This is my main computer. I spent a lot of time with it. It has 8GB of RAM, an Intel Core i5 at 3.3Gh. The Operating System on this computer is Mint Linux. I also have Windows 7 installed just to play games.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Torrent:</b>This is the computer that I use for old PC games and other Windows Related Software so I have Windows XP installed for more compatibility. It has 1,5GB of RAM, an Intel Dual Core at 2.4Gh and a Galaxy GeForce 8400GS. The computer has Windows XP installed.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>GameX:</b> Another Windows Xp box. But this is full of emulators of old video game consoles and I only use it to play old console games. It's a Pentium 4 computer with 1GB of RAM.
